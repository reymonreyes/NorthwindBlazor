# NorthwindBlazor
Good day! Welcome to the NorthwindBlazor project.
This project is an an over architected implementation based on the Northwind database.
It will be following a clean architecture pattern and I will keep abstracting all of it's components whenever I can.

If you have something in mind please feel free to share it here on the discussions page https://github.com/reymonreyes/NorthwindBlazor/discussions

PS: Please bear with me as this is my own interpretation and I don't have the domain expertise.
