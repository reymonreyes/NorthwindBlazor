# Northwind Blazor
Good day! Welcome to the Northwind Blazor project.
The goal of this project is to be the most complete Blazor implementation of the Northwind MS Access database.
It will be following a clean architecture pattern and I will keep abstracting all of it's components whenever I can.

If you have something in mind please feel free to share it here on the discussions page https://github.com/reymonreyes/NorthwindBlazor/discussions

PS: Please bear with me as this is my own interpretation and I don't have the domain expertise.

Technologies:
- Blazor
- Postgresql
- Entity Framework Core
- C#
